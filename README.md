## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, including visualizations such as bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots. These visualizations help to uncover insights into how different variables like passenger class, gender, fare, age, and embarkation point affected survival outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes detailed information about the passengers, such as:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Visualizations

The analysis includes the following visualizations:

- **Survival Rate by Class**: Examines how passenger class influenced survival rates.
- **Survival Rate by Gender**: Analyzes the impact of gender on survival.
- **Fare Distribution**: Shows the distribution of fares paid by passengers.
- **Age Distribution**: Visualizes the age distribution of passengers.
- **Embarkation Points**: Highlights the survival rates based on the port of embarkation.

## Tools Used

The analysis was conducted using **Power BI**, a powerful data visualization tool that allows for interactive and insightful data exploration.
